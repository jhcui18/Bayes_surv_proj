# survival

$h(t,x)=h_0(t)e^{{\beta}x}$

$t_i$ denotes the observed or censoring time.

$z_1,...,z_p$ denotes the $p$ covariates

$\beta$ denotes the regression coefficients

$R(t_j)$ denotes subjects at risk.

# bayesian

$S_d$ and $h_d$ denote the survival and hazard function of a parametric family $d$

$M_d$ denotes the survival model

$\theta_d = \{\alpha_d,\beta_d\}$

We see that the estimated log hazard ratio for treatment $\hat\beta_{trt} = -0.49)$ is about the same as the "true" log hazard ratio used in the simple model $\hat\beta_{trt} = -0.50)$.  The estimated baseline hazard rate is $e^{âˆ’5.54} = 0.0039$, which is almost equal to the baseline hazard rate used in simple model.
